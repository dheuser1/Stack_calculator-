# Stack_calculator-
This is a calculator. It uses a linked list based stack. An expression is read in and operators and values are pushed or popped from a stack based on precedence. When an operator is popped its operands are evaluated.  This can evaluate any valid arithmetic expression made up of +,-,*,/,(). It can also tell if an expression is not valid.
